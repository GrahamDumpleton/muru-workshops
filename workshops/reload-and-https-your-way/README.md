# Reload and HTTPS beyond the defaults

Serves a small menu application with a template and a data file under
`muructl run`, which reloads on change as a development run does. Makes
the reload watch templates and data with `--reload-include`, keeps the
file the application writes on every request from triggering it with
`--reload-exclude`, and watches a slow request finish on the old
release while a new one takes over. Then adds a name to the development
certificate with `--host`, redirects HTTP to HTTPS with `--https-only`,
and serves a certificate from a local CA made with `trustme` through
`--tls-cert`. Finally moves every one of those flags into the project's
`[tool.muru.run]` table, so the command line is `muructl run` again,
and shows `--print-config` leaving the table out. Compares with
gunicorn's and uvicorn's options.

About 30 minutes, in two terminals with a document and the project's
files in an area above them. It installs `muru` and `muructl` 0.1.0a12
and `trustme` into an environment of its own, keeps its certificates
in the workspace, and serves on ports 8080 and 8443 unless you change
them.
