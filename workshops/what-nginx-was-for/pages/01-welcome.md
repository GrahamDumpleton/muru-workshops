# Welcome

Most deployments of gunicorn, uvicorn or Granian put nginx in front,
to serve static files, compress responses, send files the application
chooses, and show the site's own error and maintenance pages. This
workshop serves a small shop on the Muru daemon, with no proxy in
front, and checks each of those with curl.

The shop is in `site/` in your workspace: its application, its static
files, a report the application hands out, and its error pages.
Nothing you do here needs you to type code.

This workshop has an environment of its own with `muru` and `muructl`
installed, at release 0.1.0a11. Create it first; it takes a minute.

```{environment-create}
:title: Create the workshop environment
```

The environment is on the `PATH` of both terminals below. Check the
version of `muructl` in the terminal on the right.

```{execute}
:id: muructl-version
:session: client
:wait: prompt
muructl --version
```

```{verify}
:id: muructl-installed
:label: muructl is installed
:substrate: shell
:trigger: after:muructl-version
muructl --version
```

The daemon this workshop starts is its own, apart from any Muru daemon
you run yourself. It keeps its state, logs and cache under `muru/` in
your workspace, and its sockets in `{{ muru_run_dir }}`, which has to
be a short path because a socket's path is limited to about a hundred
bytes.

```{hint}
:title: If port {{ app_port }} is taken on your machine
The daemon serves on port {{ app_port }}. If something else already
uses that port, open the Variables dialog from the gear button in the
header of this panel and change `app_port`. Every command in the
workshop uses the new value. `muru_run_dir` is there too, should
`{{ muru_run_dir }}` be in use.
```
