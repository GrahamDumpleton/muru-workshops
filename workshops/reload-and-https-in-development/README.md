# Reload, HTTPS and HTTP/2 on your laptop

Compares what gunicorn's, uvicorn's and `muructl run`'s `--reload`
replace when a file changes, in a short document with diagrams, then
reloads a small WSGI application under `muructl run` while a client
keeps asking for it: a change switches to a new release with no
request refused, and a change with a syntax error leaves the previous
release serving. Then serves the same application over HTTPS with a
development certificate and shows HTTP/2 negotiated over TLS with
curl.

About 20 minutes, in two terminals with a document and the application
in an area above them. It installs `muru` and `muructl` 0.1.0a10 into an
environment of its own, and serves on ports 8080 and 8443 unless you
change them.
