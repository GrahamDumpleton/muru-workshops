# Run once when the codespace is created. Does what the Binder postBuild
# does, in the codespace: installs JupyterLab and the extension from the
# same pinned requirements the Binder image uses, fills a wheelhouse for
# the workshops' environments, and writes the JupyterLab overrides, with
# two differences, both because a codespace belongs to the person who
# created it, tied to their GitHub account, and persists, where a Binder
# session is an anonymous, temporary container. The welcome message is
# the Codespaces one. And workshops are not forced to trusted, so the
# learner is shown what a workshop asks to do and decides before it runs
# anything in their codespace.
#
# The analytics setting is Binder's: it reports every session's
# progress events to the sink each collection index's analytics block
# names, without asking, and the events say they came from Codespaces.
# The welcome message tells the learner that progress is reported.
